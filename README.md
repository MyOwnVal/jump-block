# Jump Indent

A lightweight VS Code extension that allows you to **jump forward and backward** between lines that share the **same indentation level**. Designed for Python and other indentation-sensitive languages.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Jump to the next or previous non-empty line with the same indentation.
- Skips over blank lines automatically.
- Places the cursor at the first non-whitespace character of the target line.
- Ideal for navigating between `try`/`except`, `if`/`elif`, or sibling blocks in Python code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

Once installed, use the following commands:

| Command                | Keybinding        | Description                               |
|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Jump To Next Block     | `Ctrl+Alt+Down`   | Jump forward to next block with same indent |
| Jump To Previous Block | `Ctrl+Alt+Up`     | Jump backward to previous block with same indent |

You can also find both commands in the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
